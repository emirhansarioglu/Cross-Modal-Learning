# Cross-Modal-Learning
The Evaluation of Cross-Modal Learning for scene classification in Remote Sensing using SAR and multispectral data provided by BigEarthNet.

SentinelDataPreparer file makes use of downloaded BigEarthNet V.2.0 dataset to analyze the data and create the zipped dataset that is later used in Google Colab enviroment.

The code for the training of the networks and the analysis of the results, including F1 scores and UMAP visualization of feature vectors generated by each network can be found in Thesis_Code.ipynb.

The additional custom loss function (cross modal focal loss) is also implemented and tested in Thesis_Code.ipynb
